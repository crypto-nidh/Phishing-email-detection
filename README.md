This project focuses on identifying and preventing phishing emails using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to analyze email content and metadata to distinguish phishing emails from legitimate ones. The project involves:

1. Data Collection: Compiling datasets of phishing and legitimate emails, including headers, body content, and links.


2. Feature Extraction: Analyzing characteristics like suspicious URLs, spelling errors, sender information, and email structure.


3. Model Development: Training machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks) on labeled datasets to detect phishing patterns.


4. Evaluation: Testing the modelâ€™s accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure reliable detection.


5. Deployment: Creating a user-friendly interface or API for real-time email detection.
